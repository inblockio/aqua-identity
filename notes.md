## Creating an instance of a template (Systems contracts - By default in the container)

- Create a new revision instance
- Link back the instance as a linked revision (followup revision)


We have systems contracts(forms template) and user contracts (forms template)
Each template should be loaded and verified
Should be the same view as the details view logic for the aqua tree (Chain details)
